-4 Attack Types
	Physical:
		Melee
		Ranged
	Magicial:
		Melee 
		Ranged

-Generic Entity Stats:
	(L)(Can be change with level up) 3 points per level
	(L)Health
	Level
	(L)Weapon Proficient(Mag and Phy Melee, Ranged)
	(L)Defense Proficient(Mag and Phy Melee, Ranged)
	Attack
	Armor
	(L)Speed
	
Example Entity:
	level:1
	health:10
	Wp:5,0,0,0
	Def:3,0,0,0
	Attack:3
	Armor:1
	Speed:4
	
Example Player:
	level:1
	health:20
	Wp:0,0,0,0

Vocation Class can be used to defined starting items and other stats these are just the 4 pre-coded ones
new Vocation("Knight', health bonus, wp bonus, def bopnu, attack bonus, armour bonus, speed bonus, item, armor)
####    MATH

-Damage Algorithm
	//Assuming the attack is Phys Melee
	&health -= Round(_Attack * (_Wp(0)/2)) - Round(&Armor + (&Armor * (&Def(0)/10)))  

-Speed Algorithm
	velX + round(speed/2)	

Simple Leveling:
	level * 10 = xp needed
	
Xp gain
	xpCurrent += round(level/2) * xpGiven
